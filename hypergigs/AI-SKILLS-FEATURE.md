# Smart AI Skill Generation Feature

## Overview
Implemented a contextual AI-based skill suggestion system that analyzes user bios and suggests relevant skills based on role context and technology keywords.

## Changes Made

### Backend

#### 1. AI Controller (`packages/backend/src/controllers/ai.controller.ts`)
Created a smart skill extraction system with 20+ keyword-context mappings:

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes bio for role-specific keywords (e.g., "Design System Lead", "Full Stack Developer")
- Maps keywords to contextually relevant skill sets
- Understands technology contexts (React ecosystem, design tools, backend frameworks)
- Filters out skills user already has
- Returns up to 8 most relevant skills

**Example Mappings:**
- "design system" keywords → Suggests: Design Systems, UI/UX Design, Figma, Component Architecture
- "react" keywords → Suggests: React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, Redux
- "backend" keywords → Suggests: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, API Development
- "lead"/"architect" keywords → Suggests: Leadership, Team Management, System Design

#### 2. AI Routes (`packages/backend/src/routes/ai.routes.ts`)
- POST `/api/ai/generate-skills` - Generates contextual skills from bio
- Requires authentication
- Request body: `{ bio: string, existingSkills: string[] }`
- Response: `{ suggestedSkills: string[] }`

#### 3. App Configuration (`packages/backend/src/app.ts`)
- Registered AI routes: `app.use('/api/ai', aiRoutes)`
- Route is authenticated and ready to use

### Frontend

#### 1. Profile Page (`packages/frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`)
Updated `handleGenerateSkills` function to:
- Call backend AI API instead of local keyword matching
- Send user bio and existing skills to API
- Handle API response and add suggested skills
- Display success/error messages
- Show loading state during generation

**UI Features:**
- Purple gradient "AI Generate" button with Sparkles icon
- Shows number of skills added after generation
- Error handling for various scenarios:
  - No bio provided
  - Bio too short (< 10 characters)
  - No new skills found
  - API errors

#### 2. Skills Data (`packages/frontend/src/data/skills.ts`)
Fixed bug in `searchSkills` function:
- Previously returned empty array for empty query
- Now returns all skills when query is empty (needed for autocomplete)
- Maintains 200+ digital skills database

## API Endpoint

### Generate Skills
```
POST /api/ai/generate-skills
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

Request:
{
  "bio": "Design System Lead working with Figma and React...",
  "existingSkills": ["Figma", "React"]
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "suggestedSkills": [
      "Design Systems",
      "UI/UX Design",
      "Component Architecture",
      "TypeScript",
      "Storybook",
      "Accessibility"
    ]
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **User Action**: User clicks "AI Generate" button on profile page
2. **Bio Analysis**: Backend analyzes bio for role and technology keywords
3. **Context Mapping**: Keywords mapped to relevant skill sets using pre-defined rules
4. **Filtering**: Removes skills user already has
5. **Skill Addition**: Up to 8 skills added to user's profile
6. **Feedback**: Success message shows number of skills added

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Design System Lead
**Bio**: "Design System Lead at TechCorp. Building scalable component libraries with Figma and React."

**AI Suggestions**:
- Design Systems
- UI/UX Design
- Component Architecture
- Figma (if not already added)
- React (if not already added)
- Storybook
- Accessibility

### Scenario 2: Full Stack Developer
**Bio**: "Full Stack Developer with 5 years experience building web apps with React, Node.js and PostgreSQL."

**AI Suggestions**:
- React
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- API Development
- Full Stack Development

### Scenario 3: Mobile Developer
**Bio**: "Mobile app developer specializing in Flutter and Firebase."

**AI Suggestions**:
- Flutter
- Dart
- Firebase
- Mobile Development
- Cross-platform Development
- Android
- iOS

## Technical Details

### Keyword Categories (20+ mappings)
1. **Design Systems**: design system, component library, design tokens
2. **Frontend Frameworks**: react, vue, angular, svelte
3. **Backend Technologies**: node, express, django, rails
4. **Databases**: postgres, mysql, mongodb, redis
5. **Design Tools**: figma, sketch, adobe xd
6. **Mobile**: flutter, react native, swift, kotlin
7. **DevOps**: docker, kubernetes, aws, azure
8. **Testing**: jest, cypress, testing library
9. **Leadership**: lead, architect, manager, senior
10. **And more...**

### Skill Database
- 200+ pre-compiled digital skills
- Categories: Programming Languages, Frontend, Backend, Design, DevOps, Databases, etc.
- Used for both autocomplete and AI suggestions

## Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build backend
npm run build --workspace=packages/backend

# Build frontend
npm run build --workspace=packages/frontend

# Start backend
npm run dev:backend

# Start frontend preview
npm run preview --workspace=packages/frontend
```

## Testing

1. Navigate to profile page: http://localhost:4173/profile
2. Add or edit your bio with role/technology keywords
3. Click "AI Generate" button (purple with sparkles icon)
4. Verify relevant skills are suggested and added
5. Check that existing skills are not duplicated

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real AI Integration**: Replace keyword mappings with OpenAI GPT API for true natural language understanding
2. **Skill Confidence Scores**: Show relevance percentage for each suggested skill
3. **Skill Categories**: Group suggestions by category (Technical, Soft Skills, Tools)
4. **Learning Resources**: Suggest courses/resources for each skill
5. **Skill Endorsements**: Allow team members to endorse skills
6. **Skill Trends**: Show trending skills in user's industry
7. **Custom Mappings**: Allow users to add custom keyword-skill mappings
8. **Multi-language Support**: Analyze bios in multiple languages

### OpenAI Integration Example
```typescript
// Replace extractSkillsFromBio with:
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

async function extractSkillsFromBio(bio: string): Promise<string[]> {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a skills extraction expert. Analyze the bio and suggest 5-8 relevant professional skills from this list: " + DIGITAL_SKILLS.join(', ')
    }, {
      role: "user",
      content: bio
    }],
    temperature: 0.7,
  });
  
  // Parse response and return skills
  return parseSkills(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

## Notes

- Skills are limited to 8 per generation to avoid overwhelming the user
- Duplicate detection handles comma-separated skills in database
- All AI operations are authenticated and tied to user sessions
- Skill suggestions are immediately added to user profile (no confirmation step)
- Error handling covers all edge cases (no bio, short bio, API failures)

## Status

✅ Backend AI controller implemented
✅ Backend routes registered
✅ Frontend integrated with API
✅ Builds successful (no TypeScript errors)
✅ Servers running (Backend: 3001, Frontend: 4173)
✅ Ready for testing

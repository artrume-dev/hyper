- `optionalAuth`: Optional authentication for public routes with user context
- Token extraction from Authorization header (Bearer tokens)
- Request extension to include `userId`

#### **3. Authentication Controller** (`src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`)
- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register new users
  - Email format validation (regex)
  - Password strength validation (min 6 characters)
  - Username validation (3-20 chars, alphanumeric with - and _)
  - Duplicate email/username checking
  - Returns user object (without password) and JWT token
  
- **POST /api/auth/login**: User login
  - Email and password validation
  - Credential verification
  - Returns user object and JWT token
  
- **GET /api/auth/me**: Get current user profile
  - Requires authentication
  - Returns user object without password
  
- **POST /api/auth/logout**: User logout
  - Requires authentication
  - Logs event for security tracking

#### **4. Authentication Routes** (`src/routes/auth.routes.ts`)

```

#### **Business Logic:**

**Send Invitation:**
- Verify sender is team owner/admin
- Check recipient exists
- Verify recipient not already a member
- Check no pending invitation exists
- Create with 7-day expiration
- Include role for future team membership

**Accept Invitation:**
- Verify recipient is the one accepting
- Check invitation is PENDING (not already accepted/declined/expired)
- Check expiration date
- Transaction: Add to team with specified role + Update status to ACCEPTED
- Return invitation + new team membership

**Decline Invitation:**
- Only recipient can decline
- Must be PENDING status
- Update status to DECLINED

**Cancel Invitation:**
- Only sender can cancel
- Must be PENDING status
- Update status to CANCELLED

**Authorization:**
- View: Only sender or recipient
- Accept: Only recipient
- Decline: Only recipient
- Cancel: Only sender
- Team invitations: Only owner/admin of that team

#### **Request/Response Examples:**

**Send Invitation:**
```json
// Request

### Implementation

#### **Auth Infrastructure** ✅
- **Axios Instance** (`lib/axios.ts`)
  - Base URL configuration from environment variables
  - Request interceptor: Automatically adds JWT token from localStorage
  - Response interceptor: Handles 401 errors and redirects to login
  - Token storage in localStorage

- **TypeScript Types** (`types/auth.ts`)
  - User interface with all profile fields
  - UserRole type: FREELANCER | AGENCY | STARTUP
  - AuthResponse, LoginRequest, RegisterRequest types
  - AuthError type for error handling

- **Auth Service** (`services/api/auth.service.ts`)
  - register(data: RegisterRequest): Promise<AuthResponse>
  - login(data: LoginRequest): Promise<AuthResponse>
  - me(): Promise<User> - Get current user
  - logout(): Promise<void>

- **Zustand Auth Store** (`stores/authStore.ts`)
  - State: user, token, isAuthenticated, isLoading, error
  - Actions: login, register, logout, loadUser, clearError
  - Persistence: localStorage sync with zustand/persist
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Automatic token cleanup on logout

#### **Authentication Pages** ✅

**Login Page** (`pages/LoginPage.tsx`)
- Email and password form with validation
- Error display with friendly messages
- "Remember me" checkbox
- Link to registration page
- Forgot password link (placeholder)
- Loading state during authentication
- Redirects to intended page after login (from location state)
- Default redirect to /dashboard

**Register Page** (`pages/RegisterPage.tsx`)
- Full name input
- Username input (3-20 chars validation hint)
- Email input
- Password input (min 6 chars hint)
- Role selection dropdown (FREELANCER, AGENCY, STARTUP)
- Error display
- Loading state
- Link to login page

#### **Protected Routes** ✅
- **ProtectedRoute Component** (`components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
  - Checks authentication status on mount
  - Shows loading spinner while checking auth
  - Redirects to /login if not authenticated
  - Preserves intended destination in location state
  - Uses React Router's Outlet for nested routes

#### **Routes Configuration** ✅
```tsx
// Public routes
/ - Landing page
/teams - Teams listing
/freelancers - Freelancers listing
/demo - Demo page
/login - Login page
/register - Registration page

// Protected routes (requires authentication)
/dashboard - User dashboard
```

#### **Environment Configuration** ✅
- `.env` and `.env.example` files created
- `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001` configured
- Backend CORS already configured for http://localhost:5173

### API Integration Flow:

**Registration Flow:**
1. User fills registration form
2. Submit → authStore.register(data)
3. POST /api/auth/register
4. Response: { user, token }
5. Store token in localStorage
6. Update Zustand state: user, token, isAuthenticated=true
7. Navigate to /dashboard

**Login Flow:**
1. User fills login form
2. Submit → authStore.login(credentials)
3. POST /api/auth/login
4. Response: { user, token }
5. Store token in localStorage
6. Update Zustand state
7. Navigate to intended page or /dashboard

**Protected Route Flow:**
1. User navigates to /dashboard
2. ProtectedRoute component mounts
3. Calls authStore.loadUser()
4. Checks localStorage for token
5. If token exists → GET /api/auth/me
6. If valid → render protected content
7. If invalid/missing → redirect to /login with location state

**Logout Flow:**
1. User clicks logout
2. authStore.logout()
3. POST /api/auth/logout (optional, continues even if fails)
4. Clear localStorage (token, user)
5. Update Zustand state to null/false
6. Navigate to /login

### Security Features:

✅ JWT token automatic injection in all API requests  
✅ Token stored in localStorage (accessible only to same origin)  
✅ Automatic token refresh on page reload via loadUser()  
✅ 401 response handling with auto-logout and redirect  
✅ Protected routes check authentication before rendering  
✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages  
✅ Loading states to prevent UI flicker  
✅ Password input type for security  
✅ CORS configured on backend for frontend origin

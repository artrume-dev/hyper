## Codebase Analysis Summary
I've analyzed your current Teamstack platform. Here's what I found:

### 1 Current Architecture:
Backend (teamstack-api):
Ruby on Rails 5.0 API
PostgreSQL database
Devise Token Auth for authentication
Key features: Users, Teams, Projects, Invitations, Skills, Portfolios, Recommendations, Voting, Notifications

### 1.1 Frontend:
teamstack-ui: Static HTML/Bootstrap templates
teamstack-webapp: Angular 6.1 SPA with Firebase integration

### 2 Core Features Identified:

### 2.1 User Management ✓
Registration/Login (email + Google OAuth)
User profiles with skills, bio, portfolio, work experience
User types: Freelancer, Agency, Startup
Availability status tracking

### 2.2 Team Management ✓
Create/manage teams
Team invitations (teams_users with invitation_status)
Team categories
Team owner/member roles

### 2.3 Social Features ✓
User recommendations (endorsements)
Voting/points system
Notifications
Community links (social media)

### 2.4 Project Management ✓
Post projects
Project applications
Skills/categories matching

### 2.5 Messaging (mentioned in Angular but need to verify)
Appears to use Firebase for real-time chat

## 3 Recommended Simplifications:
### 3.1 Remove/Defer Complex Features:
Voting/Points/Badges system → Defer to Phase 3+
User Recommendations → Simplify to basic endorsements or defer
Project Applications → Can simplify to basic interest expression
Referral system → Defer to Phase 3+

### 3.2 Simplify Data Models:
Skills system: Merge skills and skills_root_categories into simpler structure
Community Links: Replace complex JSON with individual fields (optional)
Work Experience: Keep essential fields only

### 3.3 Replace Firebase with Native Solution:
Use Socket.io for messaging instead of Firebase
Simpler architecture, better control

## 4 Migration Mapping:
Legacy Feature	New Implementation	Priority	Simplification
Devise Token Auth	JWT + Prisma	P0	Keep core auth
teams_users invitations	Invitation model	P0	Simplify status flow
User profiles	User model + relations	P0	Remove voting/badges
Teams	Team model	P0	Keep core features
Skills	Tags/Skills array	P1	Flatten hierarchy
Projects	Project model	P1	Simplify applications
Notifications	Notification model	P1	Keep essential types
Messaging (Firebase)	Socket.io	P2	Native implementation
Portfolios	Portfolio model	P2	Keep simple version
Work Experience	WorkExperience model	P2	Essential fields only
Voting/Points	-	P3+	Defer
Recommendations	-	P3+	Defer or simplify
Referral system	-	P3+	Defer

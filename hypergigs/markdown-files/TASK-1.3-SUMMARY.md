- Update status to DECLINED

✅ **Cancel Invitations**
- Only sender can cancel

## Security & Permissions

**Authorization Matrix:**

| Action | Owner | Admin | Member | Recipient | Sender | Other |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Send invitation | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | - | - | ❌ |
| View invitation | - | - | - | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Accept invitation | - | - | - | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Decline invitation | - | - | - | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cancel invitation | - | - | - | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View team invitations | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | - | - | ❌ |

## Business Logic

### Invitation Lifecycle
```
PENDING → ACCEPTED (recipient accepts, joins team)
        → DECLINED (recipient declines)
        → CANCELLED (sender cancels)
        → EXPIRED (7 days pass)
```

### Validation Rules
1. **Send:**
   - Sender must be team owner/admin
   - Recipient must exist
   - Recipient not already a member
   - No pending invitation exists
   - Creates with 7-day expiration

2. **Accept:**
   - Must be recipient
   - Must be PENDING
   - Must not be expired
   - Transaction: Add to team + Update status

3. **Decline:**
   - Must be recipient
   - Must be PENDING

4. **Cancel:**
   - Must be sender
   - Must be PENDING

## Technical Highlights

### Transaction Safety
Accept invitation uses Prisma transaction to ensure atomicity:
```typescript
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Add user to team with specified role
  await tx.teamMember.create({ ... });
  
  // 2. Update invitation status to ACCEPTED
  await tx.invitation.update({ ... });
});
```

### Field Naming Fix
- Corrected field naming from `recipientId/recipient` to `receiverId/receiver` to match Prisma schema
- Updated all service, controller, and test files

### Middleware Integration
- Fixed `req.userId` access (middleware sets `userId`, not `user.userId`)
- All routes protected with `authenticate` middleware
